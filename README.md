# Python Project Generator (PPG)

**Description:**

This is a Python project that provides a foundational structure for application development. It automates the setup of a virtual environment, installation of dependencies, and configuration of essential directories and files for development. This setup is ideal for developers looking to kickstart their projects quickly and efficiently.

## Features

- **Project Structure**: Automatically creates a main project folder with essential subdirectories such as `src`, `data`, `logs`, and `images`.
- **Virtual Environment**: Configures a virtual environment using `venv` to manage project dependencies effectively.
- **Dependency Management**: Installs essential Python modules like `requests`, `flask`, and `numpy` for web development and data handling.
- **Initial Files**: Generates base files like `README.md`, `requirements.txt`, and starter scripts to facilitate project documentation and dependency management.
- **Error Handling**: Includes robust error handling in the setup script to ensure a smooth initialization process.
